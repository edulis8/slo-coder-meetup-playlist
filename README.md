# slo-coder-meetup-playlist
The SLO Code Meetup, July 11th/2015. Arrays and Objects Live Coding Session. Playlist Challenge.

My first "program" creating a randomized playlist, using arrays and objects in Javascript.

The challenge text at the live coding meet read as follows:

"JavaScript Arrays and Objects - Live Coding Project

For today’s project, you are going to make a song playlist.  Rather than actually playing a music file though, our playlist is going to simply display information about a song to the console.

Your program must have the following functionality:

    Your program must display the title, artist and album name of a song to the console when it is “played.”

    Your program must display this information for all songs in your playlist

    Your program must not display any songs that have already been played.

    Your program must stop when all the songs in your playlist have been played.

    Songs should be played in random order.



Each of your songs should be an object created with a single constructor.

Each song should contain properties for title, artist, and album

Each song should also contain a method that will cause the song to add itself to a playlist.

Your playlist should be an array of song objects.

A correct song display will look similar to:

title: Enter Sandman

artist: Metallica

album: The Black Album

Songs should not display their methods, only their properties.  

Songs properties should be displayed using a for...in loop

In order to randomize your playlist, Google the Math.floor and Math.random methods from JavaScript.  "
